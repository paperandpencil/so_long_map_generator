# To generate a map
python3 so_long_map_generator.py

# Description
* Currently, only algo_v1() aka "random_digger", is available.
* Stay tuned, as I plan to implement more algorithms, as I go through the "Mazes For Programmers" book.

Generated map will:
- be 25 cells wide, 15 cells high
- (probabilistically) filled with up to, 42, collectibles
- have only one 'P'
- have only one one 'E'
- have spaces where the player can move, as '0's
- be surrounded by walls ('1's)

Hope that this will be of some benefit to those that are coming after us.
